Several things would do 
First the service should be i a private subnet, behind the load balancer in the public subnet. This would require me to configure a NATGateway which is expensive. But in an enterprise environment this obviously would be manndatory

I have saved a sample terraform form file. I haven't debugged it but it should work if i were to spend time on it. I must admit i could have made terrafomr better but i honestly copied modules from random places and assembled it. I know what i need it to do. 
But there are opportunities to use more data sources and mapping the DNS and  TLS cert. 
I also could have looked into creating workspaces for different envs 

I have to admit a frustrating failure. For the life of me i couldn't figure out what i was doing wrong in failing to dfeploy this using ECS which would have solve many problems related to best practice implementation. Also FARGATE was incompatible witht he base image or so it seemed. I gave up after a few days. I had really hoped to blow your imnds with a terraform that would do everything from creating a bastion host to deploying a whole mini env pub/priv subnets, natgs, VPCs and all ... but alas... time wasn't my friend here

This is sorely in need of a CICD Pipeline.. Either Jenikns or Code Deploy would suffice

I'm actually in Greece right now to celebrate a brother's 40th but i literally worked all night till just now to make sure i don't deplay any longer. Really curious what you all think.

It's rudimentary but i hope to have showcased my ability to find answers even when they aren't second nature :) 

If you insist by the way. I can complete the terraform in a couple of day wheni return stateside.
